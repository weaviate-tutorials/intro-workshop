## Introduction to Weaviate - Online Workshop

This repository contains files related to the "Introduction to Weaviate" workshops, which we run periodically for an enthusiastic audience.

The repository is live, and will be updated with new content as we run more workshops and iterate from your feedback.

You can run the code using an online environment such as Google Colab, or locally.

## Notebooks explained

The notebooks are numbered based on the order in which they are used in the workshop. The notebooks are as follows:

- `0_starter_examples.ipynb`: Simple, starter examples to demonstrate basic, high-level concepts
- `1_weaviate_examples.ipynb`: A set of examples for the instructor to talk through
- `1a_hands_on_queries.ipynb`: Similar to `1_weaviate_examples.ipynb`, but designed for the audience to go through themselves
- `2_build_new_db.ipynb`: A notebook to demonstrate how to build a new Weaviate database - from spinning up an instance to data ingestion and queries
- `z_optional_explain_vectors.ipynb`: An optional notebook for explaining how vectors represent meaning

### Weaviate Cloud Services

Some of the workshop code and examples are written around Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS).
You can sign up to WCS and create a free sandbox instance at `https://console.weaviate.cloud`.
