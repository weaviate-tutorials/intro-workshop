## Introduction to Weaviate - Online Workshop

This repository contains files related to the "Introduction to Weaviate" workshops, which we run periodically for an enthusiastic audience.

The repository is live, and will be updated with new content as we run more workshops and iterate from your feedback.

You can run the code using an online environment such as Google Colab, or locally.

### Weaviate Cloud Services

Some of the workshop code and examples are written around Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS).
You can sign up to WCS and create a free sandbox instance at `https://console.weaviate.cloud`.
