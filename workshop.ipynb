careful, because you can't always undo some of these undos.\n","This is one of the few areas in Git where you may lose some work if you do it wrong.\n","\n","One of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly forget to add some files, or you mess up your commit message.\n","If you want to redo that commit, make the additional changes you forgot, stage them, and commit again using the `--amend` option:\n","\n","[source,console]\n","----\n","$ git commit --amend\n","----\n","\n","This command takes your staging area and uses it for the commit.\n","If you've made no changes since your last commit (for instance, you run this command immediately after your previous commit), then your snapshot will look exactly the same, and all you'll change is your commit message.\n","\n","The same commit-message editor fires up, but it already contains the message of your previous commit.\n","You can edit the message the same as always, but it overwrites your previous commit.\n","\n","As an example, if you commit and then realize you forgot to stage the changes in a file you wanted to add to this commit, you can do something like this:\n","\n","[source,console]\n","----\n","$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'\n","$ git add forgotten_file\n","$ git commit --amend\n","----\n","\n","You end up with a single commit -- the second

But then, in 2002, a new tool called BitKeeper came along. BitKeeper helped Linux and its friends work together on the project 🤝.\n","\n","But, uh-oh! In 2005, BitKeeper had some problems with the company that made it 😱.

Git was super fast and could handle big projects like the Linux kernel.

Everything they needed was right there on their own computers 🖥️. It was like magic ✨!\n","\n","Git made things so easy that Linux and its friends could even work offline or without a VPN. They could make changes and save them until they had a network connection to share them with others. It was so convenient! ✈️🚂\n","\n","And the best part was that Git could do all of this without needing to ask a remote server for help.
